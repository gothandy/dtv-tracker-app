## Reporting
### What mechanism?
Reporting need a mechanism for running pivot tables in Excel for adhoc reporting. Options include
1. Create a denormalised dataset and just open in CSV.
2. Similar but add to Excel with a blank pivot table setup ready to go.
3. Use Power Pivot and with a Data Model that draws on live data via an API?

Users are generally not excel experts and may not have a full install of Excel with our licences ideally optomised for online only.
